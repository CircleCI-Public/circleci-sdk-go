    The Usage API is an API provided by CircleCI to customers to access all of their usage data on CircleCI. It contains all the metadata (org, project, pipeline, workflow, and job dimensions) as well as credit consumption data. It is provided at the near lowest level of granularity (at the job run level).

    __Restrictions__

    * Max result set size of 100MB
    * Query timeout of 4 hours.
    * Max date window of 32 days
    * 13 months of historical data is available
    * No PII is surfaced in the Usage API (e.g. email address, Github login name)
    * The POST endpoint can only be queried up to (i.e. is rate limited to) 10 times per hour per org
    * The GET endpoint can only be queried up to (i.e. is rate limited to) 10 times per minute per org
    * To increase performance the API can generate multiple CSV files that need to be merged after download

    __Requirements__

    * organization ID - To get your organization ID go to to Organization Settings tab in the CircleCI app. ie https://app.circleci.com/settings/organization/<vcs>/<org name>/overview
    * API Personal Access Token - https://circleci.com/docs/managing-api-tokens/

                     Please note that Insights is not a financial reporting tool and should not be used for precise credit reporting.  Credit reporting from Insights does not use the same source of truth as the billing information that is found in the Plan Overview page in the CircleCI UI, nor does the underlying data have the same data accuracy guarantees as the billing information in the CircleCI UI.  This may lead to discrepancies between credits reported from Insights and the billing information in the Plan Overview page of the CircleCI UI.  For precise credit reporting, always use the Plan Overview page in the CircleCI UI.
